This is the repository for Jackie Luke and Rachel Fuller's final project for
CSCI1470.

The project will use the Sketchy Database (http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/) to identify hand drawn
sketches of animals using architectures described in Lu and Tran, Stanford 2017.

----------------- How to run: -----------------
To run the model, python3 assignment.py <BASIC/RESNET> <filepath>
You can choose to run the basic model, which is simply convolutional layers, or
the resnet model, which includes resnet blocks. You also need to supply a file path
to a file that contains the labels you want to categorize, one per line.
For example, if you wanted to categorize snakes and hot air balloons the file would look like this:

snake
hot-air_balloon

----------------- Description of overall architecture: -----------------
We read in the desired inputs from the dataset based on the filepath provided
in the arguments. From there, we preprocess the data to make it 128x128x1 and
separate it into test and train data.

Next, we create the appropriate model type and run our forward pass on batches of the data,
which can be specified in the model. We then compute loss for our backpropagation using
cross-entropy loss between the logits and the data.
After the training is complete, we run the test data on the now-trained layers and report
the test accuracy. We also print out the accuracy for the top-three categories.
For example, an image that is actually butterfly with top-three categories
[ant, chicken, butterfly] would be counted as correct for this metric.

----------------- Basic model: -----------------
Our basic model uses 3 convolutional layers with max-pooling,
batch-normalization and relu between layers. We also have a dropout layer with dropout of
0.3 after our dense layer.

----------------- Resnet model: -----------------
Each resnet block consists of two convolutions with batch normalization and relu between them added to the result
of the previous resnet block. There are a total of 9 of these blocks.
The model has series of three resnet blocks of the same size. Every three blocks,
we run a dropout layer, and increase the filter size by two. For example, we go from 64x64x64
for our first resnet block to 32x32x128 for the next set. Lastly, we flatten run a dense layer to output
the logits.

----------------- Making the dataset: -----------------
This is not necessary to use for general use because this has already been done for the data we intend to use.
However, if someone wanted to change our model to use a different dataset they could use these functions.
